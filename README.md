<h1 align="center">Hey There, I'm Jack!</h1>
<p align="center">I am a 16 year old full-stack developer from California. I'm currently in high school but outside of schooling I spend the vast majority of my free time learning primarily programming languages such as JavaScript, C, and Go. Thank you for stopping by my GitHub page, I hope you enjoy my work.</p>
